This is the my first post after configuring my site to use github pages, and more specifically, after I started using Jekyll.

Jekyll is a really cool framework for generating static content pages. This allows me to not worry about where or how I save my page. I can even have it delivered through Dropbox, which is pretty awesome.

Anyhow, I'm starting to like Jekyll, even if it has a couple of quirks.
