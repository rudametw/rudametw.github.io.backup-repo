I was wondering in the streets of Rennes, when I asked a native what was going on.
The native person looked at me funny and said in french "Monsieur, monsieur, vous ne savez pas ? Aujourd'hui c'est le plus grand jour dans l'histoire de Rennes !"

I said, what? How lucky I am! What is this day you talk so highly of?

And then native responded in perfect english so that it be clear: "Today the sun has come out, it shines so bright... and the birds fly and they chirp, what a delight... but this is only because the great Erwan Bousse has come to save the beautiful Clementine for life."

I finally understood, and Marcia and I ran for dear life. How would we live with ourselves if we missed out?

##The search
But we were too late! We missed them! They had already arrived. Nevertheless, I found evidence of his greatness. The chariot of happiness, low and behold.

</a>

We ran in the tall building, and we searched and searched. We finally arrived at the weirdest of places. The energy was strong and glowing, in this yellow room. We could feel the love.

##We found them... but

We found the great Erwan, and Clementine too. We thought theid be happy, but they didn't look so.

They looked more scared, and nervous than not. Maybe the quest was just too hard.

If you don't believe me, have a look for yourself!

</a>

I do have to admit though, they were a bit surprised. We were there uninvited, and I forgot my disguise. As any good mexican, I paid no importance to such a small detail.

##The time had come
It was time. The King of Rennes was ready. "It is now or never" we heard him rumble.

The people rushed through the small door. They pushed and shoved to be the first to see.

</a>

Marcia and I were the last, too scared to run in. What if we crossed the wrong person?

An old man approached us, he seemed happy and wise. He asked who we were, and looked a little surprised.

I asked who he was, and he tilted his head. He said "I'm the father of"... damn, I can't remember the name, so lets call him Michel. He saw my confusion, and then uttered "Michel says Erwan is his son. Since Michel is my son, I have come to accept Erwan as my grandson". The man seemed proud of Erwan, he said his name with might. I felt honored to have been there.

##No where to sit
The room was quite crowded, nowhere to sit. But that's just fine, I prefer to stand when in the presence of greatness.

##The moment of truth

The moment of truth was there, everyone was in wait. You could see the faces glowing, such an event was finally coming to be.

</a>

And then it happened, the King declared them to be in love.
He said "What's done is done, and cannot be undone".
He added "and this is done, forever and ever".

##The emotions were high

The people shouted in joy. I was so surprised. It was such a strong moment, I hid in a bush.
It was awesome and awesome. The people clapped for so long.

Erwan began the end of this important moment.
He prepared the rings of his alliance for life.

</a>

##It had been done
What's done is done rang through my head. I didn't understand the greateness of what I had witnessed.

We exited the building, not knowing what to expect. We were filled with joy and waited for more.

The Great Erwan and Clementin Bousse came out. Their presence was enough for the people to shout. The people celebrated and beautiful things were said, and even a song came out.

</a>

The Great Bousses are not ones to keep separate from the classes.
They joined their people in this celebration, and the roses came out.

</a>
If you look closely at the picture, some of the people kneeled.
They respect and love the Great Bousses.
There is no doubt.

## The Great Erwan was happy

</a>

You could see it in his face.
The event of a lifetime had since taken place.

No more to say, only to laugh and celebrate.
He was so happy, he had the love of his now wife.

I was happy too, and in the mist of things, I got close.
Somewhat unprepared, I finally got my shot.

</a>

The moment was so wonderful, I'm happy I was there.

I leave this here, to share will all of you!

Congratulations Erwan and Clementine!!!
