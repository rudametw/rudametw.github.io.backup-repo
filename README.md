This repository is for my github-pages personal website.

I'm currently using Jekyll to create a static website.

All source files are in the `src` directory. After editing source files, I run `./update_site.sh` to copy the files in the generated `src/_site` folder to the root of the repo.

I'm currently using the following tools to build this site:
Jekyll
Jekyll-assets
gallery_generator (for the photo gallery)
sitemap_generator
Bootstrap
JQuery
Fancybox
Fontawesome,
and a couple of other things that haven't come to mind.

You can visit the resulting website at the following addreses:
